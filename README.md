# Zucc-Succ

Zucc Succ was the first ever project that I self made on MIT app inventor. This was my practice project for the final AP project for AP Computer Science Principles. I had fun with this project and designed the game as Mark Zuckerberg being a lizard that eats flies. While creating this project I got really good at using sprites in MIT app inventor. sprites were used as the flies, onions, and the lizards tounge. I coded the app so that where ever the screen was tapped, the lizards tounge would go there. the objective was for the user to not touch the onions, because onions are poisonous to lizards.
